DQL – Data Query Language

🔹 Definition:
DQL is used to retrieve data from database tables.

🔹 Main Command:

SELECT → To fetch data.

Basic Syntax
SELECT column1, column2 
FROM table_name 
WHERE condition 
ORDER BY column_name ASC|DESC;

Key Features

SELECT → Fetch data

SELECT * FROM emp;


WHERE → Apply condition

SELECT * FROM emp WHERE emp_salary > 30000;


ORDER BY → Sort results

SELECT * FROM emp ORDER BY emp_name DESC;


DISTINCT → Remove duplicates

SELECT DISTINCT dept_id FROM emp;


LIKE → Pattern matching

SELECT * FROM emp WHERE emp_name LIKE 'A%';


GROUP BY → Group rows

SELECT dept_id, COUNT(*) FROM emp GROUP BY dept_id;


HAVING → Filter groups

SELECT dept_id, AVG(emp_salary) 
FROM emp 
GROUP BY dept_id 
HAVING AVG(emp_salary) > 50000;


👉 Note:

DQL only retrieves data, does not modify it.

emp_id / dept_id (numbers) should be used as keys instead of names, because names may contain spaces or case differences.
