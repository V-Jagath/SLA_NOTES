full join -return all rows for both 

slef join 

join with itself . hirarical ku use agum(postion step by step)  

same table link.

coross join (or) carticion join important for phython
	
cartision join formula:-

every row form first table * every row form second table


using testing and compition ku use agum

inner, left join is most use agum 

IS NULL -->

IF NULL -->

TCL - Transaction Control Language  (before gpay la money marubadium namma account ku vara help aguthu) 
dcl - security based important
tricar - mostly used.
grit operations in sql important interview questions
insert update delete and etc..

tricar is special stored program in sql that automatically executes when an event insert update and delete. its automattacally run agaum.
auto action changes on anather table becasue security purpose.
ethaathu oru table la insert update and delete achuna automatically run agum ithu vera oru table la datas store agum.

tyeps of tricars:-

1.Before tricar :-

	security purpose ku use agum. waring kodukum.validation purpose ku use agum. invalid data va avoid panna use agum

2. After Tricars:-

	logging la use agum. updated antother table

EVENTS

before  insert 
after insert
before  update
after update
before  delete
after delete

trigger only use stroed procudure only not a fetch ku use agathu.

comments :-

1. delimitor - change delimitor from 

change delimitor you can give any two spical chractors 

demitor #$

2. CREATE TRIGGER triggar_name BEFORE OR AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON table_name 
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN 
statements anather_table //(mostly dml ha tha irukum) or(if condition)
END #$(because delimitor #$)

delimitor ;

example:-

insert example:-

DELIMITER $$
CREATE TRIGGER insert_data(ithu trigger ku oru name namma kodurathu) AFTR INSERT ON employees(ithu table name)
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
INSERT INTO Auditlog (actiontype,empid,newsalary) values ("insert",new.empid,new.salary);
end$$
DELIMITER ;

🔹 SQL Joins

INNER JOIN

Returns only matching rows from both tables.

Most commonly used.

LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)

Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right.

If no match, NULL is returned from the right table.

FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)

Returns all rows from both tables, matched or unmatched.

If no match, NULL is shown for missing values.

SELF JOIN

Join a table with itself.

Used for hierarchical data (example: employee & manager relationship).

SELECT e.emp_name, m.emp_name AS manager
FROM employees e
JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.emp_id;


CROSS JOIN / CARTESIAN JOIN

Returns all combinations → Formula:

Total Rows = Rows(Table A) × Rows(Table B)


Example: 5 rows × 4 rows = 20 rows.

Used for testing and sometimes in Python pandas.

🔹 NULL Handling

IS NULL → Check if a value is NULL.

IFNULL(expr, value) → Replace NULL with a given value.

SELECT emp_name, IFNULL(salary, 0) FROM employees;

🔹 SQL Control Languages

TCL (Transaction Control Language)

COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT

Example: GPay money reversal → rollback before commit.

DCL (Data Control Language)

GRANT, REVOKE → security-based, permissions.

🔹 Triggers (Very Important in Interviews 🚀)

A trigger is a stored program in SQL that automatically runs when INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE happens.

👉 Use cases:

Auto logging

Security validation

Audit trail

🔸 Types of Triggers:

BEFORE Trigger

Runs before the action.

Used for validation/security (avoid invalid data).

AFTER Trigger

Runs after the action.

Used for logging, auditing.

🔸 Trigger Events:

BEFORE INSERT, AFTER INSERT

BEFORE UPDATE, AFTER UPDATE

BEFORE DELETE, AFTER DELETE

🔸 Syntax:
DELIMITER $$

CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
BEFORE INSERT ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
   -- Statements (mostly DML)
END $$

DELIMITER ;

🔸 Example: Insert Logging
DELIMITER $$

CREATE TRIGGER insert_data
AFTER INSERT ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
   INSERT INTO auditlog (actiontype, empid, newsalary)
   VALUES ('insert', NEW.empid, NEW.salary);
END $$

DELIMITER ;


👉 Now, whenever you insert into employees,
a record is automatically inserted into auditlog.

⚡ Tip for interviews:

Always mention INNER & LEFT JOIN are most used.

Triggers are for automation, logging, validation.

TCL is for transactions, DCL is for security.
