Take all calue using column name

example - emp_nmae from emp

row vise filter

select emp_name form emp where emp_id=2;

like 

select emp_name form emp where emp_name like  "%a"

starting ---> R%
Ending ---> %A

select count (*) from emp

count no of total_datas

select avg (column name) from emp

Aggrigate Funtions:-

Build-in Funtions

count () --> overall count for that table 
max() ---> 
avg() --->
sum --->
min--->


group by ---> group by

limit 

select * From Emp Limit2;

updated by, updated at (extra id)
inserted at, inserted by


----------------------------------------------------------------------

🔹 1. Select column values

To take data from specific column →

SELECT emp_name FROM emp;


This will return only the emp_name column (not all columns).

🔹 2. Row-wise filtering (WHERE clause)

Filter specific rows using WHERE:

SELECT emp_name FROM emp WHERE emp_id = 2;


👉 Only employee with emp_id = 2 will be shown.

🔹 3. LIKE operator

Used for pattern matching.

Starts with "R":

SELECT emp_name FROM emp WHERE emp_name LIKE 'R%';


Ends with "A":

SELECT emp_name FROM emp WHERE emp_name LIKE '%A';


Contains "a" anywhere:

SELECT emp_name FROM emp WHERE emp_name LIKE '%a%';

🔹 4. Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions = summarize multiple rows.

Count total rows

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM emp;


Maximum salary

SELECT MAX(salary) FROM emp;


Minimum salary

SELECT MIN(salary) FROM emp;


Average salary

SELECT AVG(salary) FROM emp;


Sum of salary

SELECT SUM(salary) FROM emp;

🔹 5. GROUP BY

Used to group rows based on a column → useful in reports/dashboard.

Example: Average salary by department:

SELECT dept_id, AVG(salary) 
FROM emp 
GROUP BY dept_id;


👉 Without GROUP BY → only one average for whole table.
👉 With GROUP BY → one average for each department.

🔹 6. HAVING

WHERE = filter individual rows.

HAVING = filter grouped results.

Example: Only show departments with average salary > 30000:

SELECT dept_id, AVG(salary) 
FROM emp 
GROUP BY dept_id 
HAVING AVG(salary) > 30000;

🔹 7. LIMIT

Used to restrict number of rows in result (MySQL, PostgreSQL).

First 2 rows:

SELECT * FROM emp LIMIT 2;


First 5 employees with highest salary:

SELECT * FROM emp ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 5;

🔹 8. Extra (for dashboards / audit columns)

Many companies keep tracking columns in tables:

inserted_by → who inserted the record

inserted_at → when it was inserted

updated_by → who last updated

updated_at → when it was updated

👉 Example table:

CREATE TABLE emp (
  emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  emp_name VARCHAR(50),
  salary DECIMAL(10,2),
  dept_id INT,
  inserted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  inserted_by VARCHAR(50),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_by VARCHAR(50)
);


✅ Summary

WHERE → filter row by row

LIKE → pattern search (R%, %a)

Aggregate Functions → COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX

GROUP BY → group rows (by dept, etc.)

HAVING → filter grouped results

LIMIT → restrict number of rows
