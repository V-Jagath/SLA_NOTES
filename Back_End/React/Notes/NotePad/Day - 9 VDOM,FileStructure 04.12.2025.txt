React router DOM -its using for Single Page Application

virtual DOM - Diffing and reconlication

Virtual DOM - React does not update the real dom directly

what is real DOM ?

html tree - structue - object

first react create a light weight copy of the DOM in memory. This is a copy is called virtualDOM (VDOM - Virtual DOM).

WHy React using VDOM:-

the react dom is slow update every change triggers enpensive browser operations.
like 

REflow,
repaint,
layout calculations


** that 2 topics very important for interview
What is DIFFING ? (the algorith in react)
Recinsiliation
1. DIFF Algorithm :-

	when your UI needs to change 
1. react builds a new virtual dom tree
2. campare it with the old tree(VDOM).
3. Finds the smallest possible changes
4. Update only those parts in the real dom.

this comparison process = diffing


2.RECONSILIATION :-

Reactfull process of updating the UI>

1. Receive NEW UI (any change)
2. Create a new Virtual DOM 
3. Diff old VDOM and New DOM
4. Deside which nodes need to be update remove/Add
5. apply minimal updates to real dom.

STEP 1:-

React converts Your JSX to virtual DOM tree

Step 2:-

when ever data changes,react re-render the components tree(not the real dom)
this produce a new VDOM

step 3:-
DIFFING Algorithm

FInd what changed, what stayed same what need to be removed, what needed to be added.

Generate part

React prepaes a patch object - list of minimal DOM Operations

Commit phaase

react real dom changes

JS ENGINE _ V8 ENGINE

VDOM create - js engine

DIff - JS ENgine

patch building - JS engine

Autual DOM Update - Browser DOM API 


CRA - its kind of webpack. its take more time because using bundle js

VITE - Roll-up more easy to build 



FILE STRUCTUTE:- VITE

1. Node Modules - Node Module is a library holding folder (library - pre defined functions)

2. Public - Absolute Path(standrad path) its handle image file

3. src - is a important main folder to execute your file 

4. gitignore - what files move to git 

5. eslint.config.js , vite.config.js - its handle configration processs (execute process) 
 
6. index.html - its a important file to render the file

7. package.json - holding dependancies file,file run comments, all downloads  

8. package-lock.json - testing purpose

9. README.md - project description

10. vite.config.js - its very important for vite

main.jsx - virtual dom create process 

app.jsx - you work starting file

app.css --> normal css

index.css --> import for bootstrap and tailwind. because, its use all files


const App=()=>{
return (

<div>
This is My First Files
</div>

)
}

export default App

why use Pascal case ?

universal all devlopers are using this becasue easy to identify.


const NavBar=()=>{

}

export default NavBar;

return 3 Methods :-

()
<></>
<div><div/>


Fragment :- 

single parent or one parent element for maintaining multiple child tags.


TASK :-
