Website Devlopment Before React:-

HTML,CSS,BOOTSRAP,TAILWINDCSS

JS:-
DOM API DATA PROCESS OF OBJECT MODEL
DYNAMIC WEB APPLICATION

BACKEND:-
JAVA,PYTHON,PHP

DATABASE :-

SQL

Problems:-

1. code writing lot of code need to write

2. Reload the whole page for single update

3. We can't do any reuse style and functions


Making library :-

1. Jquery
2. json
3. ajax

they librarys are working together html,css,other front end dev tools.

FRAMEWORK :-

Predefinded structure
file structure
file handling
folder name
code
all already predefinded

LIBRARY:-

someone write the code fot this its like buildin but not fixed file 
handlings and folder handling and code also indipentent.

React:-

1. React is a javascript library. for building user interfaces. 

1. CRA (old and basic)
2. VITE (Modern/Advanced) 

2. Mainly we make single page application (SPA).
3. It was created by Facebook(Meta).
4. Component based architecturre
5. It's Declarative library that helps us to build dynamuc and fast front end application.
6. In the React we can use js to jsx process then we have  compilers for this process.
7. React mainly process like Transpilar

React is not a compiler to compile the code . its just library.

3 important tools:-

JSX to JS
TSX to JS

1. JSX is not understand browser. so we, use Bable compailar is a transpilar it convert jsx to js.

transpilar ---> high level language(ts,jsx) to other high level language(js) ----> machine language 

2. MODULE BUNDING

Bundle - webpack/vite/parcel

js files css files images json components assets all files are 

3. V8 ENGINE:-

js engine = interpreter + JIT Compiler


jsx+es6+component ---> Babale ---> jsx,tsx,ts -->JS,es6+ -->ES5

parse-bytcode --> machine code

UI Render


compiler---> high level language to machine code  


1. CREATE PHASE
2. UPDATE PHASE
first 2 is very important
3. OPTIMIZE PHASE

NODE --> js basic server or direct js code (Run time Environment) 

NPM - Note Package Manager

NPX - Node Package eXecute


1. CREATE PHASE

1. CRA Method(old and basic)
npx create react app
localhost:3000
project setup - npm and npx

CRA is the old official tool to set up a react project . it uses webpack under the hood. 

Befifits:-
1. zero configuration
2. stable for many years 
3. great for beginners

Problems :-
1. very slow startup
2. slow build time
3. Heavy webpacl bundling
4. Hard to customize
5. Maintence droped

2. VITE Method (Modern and Advanced)
vite default localhost:5173
npm create vite@latest viteReact

Vite next Generation front end build tool devloped by (VUE js create)
Vite stands for fast

ES Build super fasr go_based complier

Roll up -->

its very fast
